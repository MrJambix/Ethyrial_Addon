// Important Considerations:
//Game API: Replace the placeholder functions (get_all_arcaneblooms, get_player_position) with actual code to interface with your game's API.

//Language and Environment: The actual implementation language and environment (e.g., Unity with C#, Unreal Engine with C++, a custom engine, etc.) will dictate how you access game world data and player information.

//Performance: Be mindful of the performance impact. Continuously fetching data and calculating distances can be resource-intensive.

//Updates and Synchronization: Ensure your logic accounts for dynamic changes in the game world, such as player movement and changes in the positions of "ArcaneBloom".

//Compliance with Game Rules: Ensure this functionality aligns with the game's terms of service and ethical guidelines, especially in multiplayer scenarios.
