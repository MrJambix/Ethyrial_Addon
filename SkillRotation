# Ethryial Skill Rotation Script Template

## Description

This repository hosts a template for an AutoIt script specifically designed for the Brawler class in the game Ethryial. The script is intended as a pedagogical tool to demonstrate a theoretical approach to automating a skill rotation. It provides a fundamental framework for simulating key presses corresponding to different Brawler class skills, based on predefined conditions and timers.

**Disclaimer:** This script serves as an educational template only. It is not intended for use in actual gameplay in Ethryial or any other game. Automating gameplay can violate the terms of service of many online games, leading to penalties including account suspension or bans. Users should always respect the game's rules and prioritize fair gameplay.

## Features

- Automated key press simulation for Brawler class skill rotation.
- Basic cooldown management logic for skills.
- Conceptual function structure for tracking in-game parameters (e.g., Martial Combo Stacks).

## Requirements

- [AutoIt v3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/): The script is written in the AutoIt scripting language and requires AutoIt v3 for execution.

## Installation

1. Install AutoIt v3 from its [official website](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/).
2. Clone this repository or download the script file to your local machine.

## Usage

To use this template:

1. Open the script file in the AutoIt Script Editor.
2. Customize the hotkey variables to fit your configuration in Ethryial.
3. Execute the script via the AutoIt Script Editor, or compile it into an executable.

**Note:** This script should not be used in actual Ethryial gameplay as it may be against the game's terms of service.

## Script Overview

The script comprises the following components:

- **Global Variables:** Define the hotkeys for each Brawler skill.
- **Main Loop:** Continuously checks for conditions to initiate the skill rotation.
- **PerformRotation Function:** Implements the skill rotation, simulating key presses according to the game's current state.
- **Conceptual Functions:** Include placeholders for logic to determine the start of the rotation (`SomeCondition`) and for hypothetical tracking of game-specific parameters (`GetMartialComboStacks`).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, particularly in enhancing the script's logic and expanding its functionality within ethical and fair play guidelines.
